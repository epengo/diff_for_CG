# diff_for_CG

Takes some output generated by different tools.
Every tool has it's own loader. Loaders have 2 methods:

# load
A loader loads a given file format and reads all the methods.
It tries to match the loaded method to an already existing method. If it can't match to anything, it creates a new Id and stores the method.

# connection Transformation
It tries to transform the connections. Instead of the names used by the tool it stores the ids assigned by the load method.
Returns the connection set. It is a set of pairs of ids.

Tools can be compared by their sets of connection.

# sum up the results

The tool will create a lot of tsv files and txt files, and a list file. If You want to sum up the tsv files run the commonTSV program with the parameter of teh resulting lst file, or pass the tsv-s one by one. You'll get a common.tsv file, which contains all the tsvs' information in one table.
